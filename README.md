Hey! My name is Mayara and I'm the art director of the 15!20 agency. Also, architect.
I've been working as a graphic designer for over 10 years and I've already worked actively in some companies and today I have the agency 15!20 Comunicação Integrada.
We are a young company and we operate in the market with great integrity and discernment. Our main objective is to provide a brand that conveys the essence of the customer and proves its quality.
